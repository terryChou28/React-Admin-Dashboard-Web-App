# React-Admin Dashboard Web App

## What will the application do?
- The application allows the user to choose between a to-watch movie list or a watched movie list. After selecting a list, the user can add an arbitrary number of movies to the list, remove the added movies, view the list, rate the movies, and the app also tells the user which movie has the highest approval rating on the list.

## Who will use it?
- Any user who loves watching movies!

## Why is this project of interest to you?
- This project is of interest to me because I enjoy watching movies, and it is often hard to keep track in my head which movies I haven't seen and which ones I have. So designing this movie list app allows me to group them into different lists while keeping track of their approval ratings from Rotten Tomatoes and my own user ratings as well.
